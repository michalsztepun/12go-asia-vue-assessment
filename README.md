# 12go-asia-vue-assessment

I have used Vite for the scaffold of this assessment and Vitest for testing. There are 3 main files to look at:

- **src/components/PhoneInput.vue** - Single-file component with the logic.
- **src/views/DemoPage.vue** - Vue page with PhoneInput component imported.
- **src/components/__tests__/PhoneInput.spec.ts** - Unit tests for PhoneInput component.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```
